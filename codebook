**codebook for run_analysis.*

This codebook shows the work flow from reading the raw data files to obtain the final output.

The file works by first reading the files from the two main folders: “test” and “train”

Following which I renamed the activity labels into the various activities as such to remove ambiguities:

1.	Walking  (Activity label 1 is walking)
2.	Walkingupstairs
3.	Walkingdownstairs
4.	Sitting
5.	Standing
6.	Laying

The next step was to form up the table for the Training Subjects, by cbinding the following files:

1.	subject_train.txt   (shows the ID number of volunteers)

2.	Y_train.txt   (Activity lables)

3.	body_acc_X_train.txt

4.	body_acc_Y_train.txt   

5.	body_acc_Z_train.txt

6.	body_gyro_X_train.txt

7.	body_gyro_Y_train.txt

8.	body_gyro_Z_train.txt

9.	total_acc_X_train.txt

10.	total_acc_Y_train.txt

11.	total_acc_Z_train.txt

Files 3 to 11 are found in the “Inertia Signals” sub-folder under “Train” 

The same was then repeated to construct a table for the Test subjects.

Next the two tables were combined and renamed to be “combined” using “rbind” and columns were renamed by removing the “test” and “train” words.

Finally the “dplyr” package was loaded and combined table was grouped by subjectID and Activity. The grouped table is renamed to be combinedgrouped.
.
And the means of each variable by activity and by subject was calculated and stored as mean_byID_byactivity.
